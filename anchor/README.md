# Anchor Vault Program

This template includes a simple SOL vault program built with [Anchor](https://www.anchor-lang.com/).

## Pre-deployed Program

The vault program is deployed on **devnet** at:

```
F4jZpgbtTb6RWNWq6v35fUeiAsRJMrDczVPv9U23yXjB
```

You can interact with it immediately by connecting your wallet to devnet.

## Deploying Your Own Program

To deploy your own version of the program:

### 1. Generate a new program keypair

```bash
cd anchor
solana-keygen new -o target/deploy/vault-keypair.json
```

### 2. Get the new program ID

```bash
solana address -k target/deploy/vault-keypair.json
```

### 3. Update the program ID

Update the program ID in these files:

- `anchor/Anchor.toml` - Update `vault = "..."` under `[programs.devnet]`
- `anchor/programs/vault/src/lib.rs` - Update `declare_id!("...")`

### 4. Build and deploy

```bash
# Build the program
anchor build

# Get devnet SOL for deployment (~2 SOL needed)
solana airdrop 2 --url devnet

# Deploy to devnet
anchor deploy --provider.cluster devnet
```

### 5. Regenerate the TypeScript client

```bash
cd ..
npm run codama:js
```

This updates the generated client code in `src/generated/vault/` with your new program ID.

## Program Overview

The vault program allows users to:

- **Deposit**: Send SOL to a personal vault PDA (Program Derived Address)
- **Withdraw**: Retrieve all SOL from your vault

Each user gets their own vault derived from their wallet address.

## Testing

From the repository root, build the current SBF binary and run the Rust tests
against LiteSVM. This does not connect to devnet or require a local validator:

```bash
npm run anchor-test
```

The suite contains 15 integration tests (11 escrow and 4 legacy badge tests),
plus the program ID unit test. After an SBF build, it can also be run directly:

```bash
cd anchor
cargo test -p repulink
```
